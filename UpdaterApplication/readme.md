# Update appsettings.json at run time

The code responsible in AppSettingsUpdater class, is not my code, the code came from a [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40970944/how-to-update-values-into-appsetting-json).

Code in this project provides the ability to update appsettings.json at runtime and reflect the changes.

Index page is not responsive.
