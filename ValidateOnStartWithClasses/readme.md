# About

An example of using custom validators for use with ValidateOnStart. In this example, validators are placed in the Validator folder, while in other cases, like a team library, the validators may reside in the team library.

---
The benefit of using custom validators is that they cleanup Program.cs, and the validators are reusable, as above, in a team or personal library.
